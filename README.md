## Explanation

I created a simple XML viewer for react with SCSS for styling with some minimal responsivness.

Because I'm not used to work with XML the first thing I've done is to convert it to JSON, I think is an easier format to navigate.

I presented two different views for the tree, a simple one surrounded of <Pre> to be able to format it clearly. The second one as a collapsilbe tree using one of the multiple packages for this. I probably could create something like this from scratch, but I belive if the tool exist, we don't really need to recreate it everytime.

## Things to DO

I didn't had the time, but this is the list of thing I wish I could do:

- Add validating for the format
- Add a more userfriendly "Drag and Drop" option.
- Add unit testing
